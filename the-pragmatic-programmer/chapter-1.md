## Tip 6: Remember the Big Picture  
    Don’t be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing
    
## Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue
* Involve Your Users in the Trade-Off
* Know When to Stop
     
## Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
### Goals
* Learn at least one new language every year
*  Read a technical book each quarter
* Read nontechnical books, too
* Take classes
* Participate in local user groups.
* Experiment with different environments
* Stay current.
* Get wired.
### Opportunities for Learning
    All of this reading and researching takes time, and time is already in
    short supply. So you need to plan ahead. Always have something to
    read in an otherwise dead moment. Time spent waiting for doctors and
    dentists can be a great opportunity to catch up on your reading—but be
    sure to bring your own magazine with you, or you might find yourself
    thumbing through a dog-eared 1973 article about Papua New Guinea    

## Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
### Critical Thinking
### Challenges
* Start learning a new language
* Start reading a new book
* Get out and talk technology with people who aren't involved in your curent project,or who don’t work for the same company. Network in your
company cafeteria, or maybe seek out fellow enthusiasts at a local user’s
group meeting

### Communicate
* I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked. ➡️ Mae West, Belle of the Nineties, 1934
